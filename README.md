# Terrago
A Terraria framework for Go

## Why?
Go is a very similiar language to C# and i wish to have some control for terraria while using my favorite language, i also this framework for my future project
in my opinion though go is way better than C# just because you don't need any dependencies to run a compiled executable from go 

## Goals
currently in mind i have a few things:
- server hosting
- world editing
- player editing (unsure)

once i at least get over world reading i can start implementing the server

## Credits
i stole and transpiled some of TEdit's source because im lazy to decompile terraria
